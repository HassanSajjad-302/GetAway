GAME RULES:


DECK OF SHUFFLED CARDS IS DISTRIBUTED AMONG PLAYERS. IF CAN'T BE DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY, SOME RANDOMLY SELECTED PLAYERS WILL GET AN ADDITIONAL CARD. THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS CAN'T BE LESS THAN 2.

IN THE FIRST ROUND, THERE IS NO TURN SEQUENCE. A PLAYER HAVING THE ACE OF SPADE MUST PLAY IT AND WILL BE THE PLAYER HAVING THE FIRST TURN IN THE NEXT ROUND. EACH PLAYER HAS TO PLAY A CARD. IF A PLAYER HAS A SPADE, THEN THAT MUST BE PLAYED. THESE CARDS WILL BE FLUSHED.

NOW EVERY PLAYER WILL PLAY ON THEIR TURN. THE PLAYER WHO PLAYS FIRST CAN PLAY ANY CARD AND SETS THE SUIT OF THE ROUND BY PLAYING THE CARD OF THAT SUIT. EVERY PLAYER HAS TO PLAY THE CARD OF THE SAME SUIT. THE TURN SEQUENCE IS RANDOMLY DETERMINED AND FOLLOWED FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS. NEXT PLAYERS ARE FREE TO PLAY ANY OF THE CARDS OF THE SUIT OF THE ROUND IF THEY HAVE MORE THAN ONE CARD OF THAT SUIT.

    IF ANY SUBSEQUENT PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE THE CARD OF THAT SUIT, THEN THAT PLAYER CAN PLAY ANY CARD AND SUBSEQUENT PLAYERS WON'T PLAY IN THAT ROUND. THE ROUND WILL BE TERMINATED BY FLUSHING THAT CARD WITH OTHER CARDS ON THE TABLE TO THE PLAYER WHO PLAYED THE HIGHEST CARD. THE PLAYER WHO HAD THE HIGHEST CARD WILL PLAY FIRST IN THE NEXT ROUND. HIGHEST CARD IS DETERMINED USING THE ORDER A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4 > 3 > 2.
    IF ALL PLAYERS PLAYED THE CARD OF THE SUIT, THEN THIS COLLECTION WILL BE FLUSHED AT THE END OF THE ROUND. THE PLAYER WHO HAD THE HIGHEST CARD WILL PLAY FIRST IN THE NEXT ROUND.
