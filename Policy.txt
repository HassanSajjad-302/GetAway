Every integer read, write will be using binary protocol while
string read, write will be using stream insertion and getline operators.

Number of bytes of packet for receive will surely be read in other
function instead of operator overload <<. While for writing the number
of bytes I am unsure whether to write them in other function or
operator overload >>.

packetsize int at the start of every message does not include
itself in the size of message.
